# Contract Explorer for Scaffold Stellar

Explore, test, and debug Stellar smart contracts directly from your dApp. Made
to work with [Scaffold Stellar](https://scaffoldstellar.org), but configurable
enough to handle any React application.

- 👀 Explore available contracts in full UI
- 🔥 View hot-reloading contract documentation in development
- 🔗 Fetch deployed contract metadata directly from the network
- ⚡️ Run or simulate transactions with validated input
- 📊 Get transaction results immediately in JSON

## Setup

```sh
npm install @theahaco/contract-explorer
```

Open your `App.tsx` file and import the `ContractExplorer` component along with
the `loadContracts` utility. This will handle parsing the RPC clients created by
Scaffold Stellar.

```js
import { ContractExplorer, loadContracts } from "@theahaco/contract-explorer"
// Import network information containing passphrase, RPC URL, etc.
import { network } from "./contracts/util"
import { useWallet } from "./hooks/useWallet"

// Import your contract modules using your preferred bundler
const contractModules = import.meta.glob("./contracts/*.ts")
// Then pass them all to our custom loader
const contracts = await loadContracts(contractModules)

function App() {
	// Connect to wallet for user's address and signTransaction function
	const wallet = useWallet()

	return (
		<>
			{/* Your app components */}

			<ContractExplorer contracts={contracts} network={network} {...wallet} />
		</>
	)
}
```

The default style is a large component which work well on a separate page when
using something like React Router.

## Modal Component

We also provide an alternative style in a modal that you can toggle with a
floating button, similar to the TanStack Query DevTools. It works exactly the
same as the default component but allows a few more props for customization:

```jsx
<ContractExplorerModal
	placement="left"
	initialIsOpen={false}
	contracts={contracts}
	network={network}
	{...wallet}
/>
```

Props:

- `placement: "left" | "right"`: placement of the modal toggle button (default
  `"right"`)
- `initialIsOpen: boolean`: initial view state of the modal on load (default
  `false`)

## Production Builds

By default, the explorer is excluded in production builds so you don't have to
worry about shipping it within your application.
